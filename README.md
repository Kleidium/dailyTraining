This MWSE mod allows you to spend time training rather than wasting time waiting!

I always thought using the "Wait" function was a waste of time/not immersive when waiting for more than a few hours. So I decided to add another option. The default settings are considered "Medium Difficulty".

## Features:

A "Train" button is added to the rest menu, which allows you to select a skill to train for the amount of hours you selected. The amount of hours you are able to train per session is limited by Willpower for magical skills and Endurance for non-magical skills. This is configurable.

Once you finish training, a cooldown is invoked. By default, the cooldown is 24 hours. This is configurable. In addition to this, Training Fatigue may reduce Endurance or Willpower temporarily.

You can disallow all training or just dangerous training in towns. You can optionally have the chance of being ambushed while training outside of towns. You can also limit the maximum skill level a skill can be trained to. The rate of experience gain is also configurable. Experience efficiency bonuses and penalties can affect how well your training sessions go.

### Training different skills requires different resources.

Training **armor skills** requires a small amount of health per hour by default.

Training **magic skills** requires a fair amount of magicka per hour by default.

Training **all other skills** requires a moderate amount of stamina per hour by default.

### An optional daily streak bonus has been included.

Once you train the same skill 3 days in a row, you gain a free hour of experience per session (no additional time required). This bonus increases with longer streaks:

*Tier 1 (3 - 7 Days): 1 free hour of training per session.
<br>
Tier 2 (7 - 30 Days): 2 free hours of training per session.
<br>
Tier 3 (30 - 180 Days): 3 free hours of training per session.
<br>
Tier 4 (180 - 365 Days): 4 free hours of training per session.
<br>
Tier 5 (365+ Days): 5 free hours of training per session.*

You can only have one streak skill active at a time. To change your streak skill, you must first break your current streak!
